# Pre-work - *CalcAnimated*

**CalcAnimated* is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **James Rochabrun**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
 - Use CoreGraphics Framework to improve the design of a static calculator
 - Use a tableView to display options to the user
 - Use delegation and NSnotificationCenter to send data and update UI.

## Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- The biggest chalenge on this exercise was to make a design that can transform a static calculator in a better product that give a better and funnier experience to the user without loosing focus in the engineering aspect of the product.
